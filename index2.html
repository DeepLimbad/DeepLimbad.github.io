<h1>History of Hacking</h1>
<p align="justify"><b>The hacker culture began in the 1960s and 1970s as an intellectual movement: exploring the unknown, 
documenting the arcane, and doing what others cannot. Many hacker subcultures developed
independently and in parallel at various universities throughout the United States: Stanford, MIT,
CalTech, Carnegie Mellon, UC Berkeley, and many others. The completion of the ARPANET linked
these campuses and they were able to share their collective experiences, their knowledge, humor and
skills. Together, they formed the first hacker culture.
Many hackers began as expert programmers: programming gurus like Richard M. Stallman, founder
of the Free Software Movement, and Linus Torvalds, creator of the Linux kernel. These programmers
were able to found new loosely-connected organizations that would push the boundaries of accepted
software engineering, and also technology. These figures serve to popularize the efforts of hacking to a
society increasingly focused on computing.
In the realm of computer security, with the advent of ubiquitous networking, a distinction began to
form between two groups: the so-called black hat and white hat hackers. Both maintain a connection
to the haker ethic, but focus on different aspects and interpretations. The black hat culture is known
for flouting authority and embracing anarchy, committing acts of mischief and malice and knowingly
breaking and entering secured systems—these are the hackers most often seen in the news and
popular culture. The white hats, the "ethical hackers", focus on other aspects of the hacker ethic: they
seek to understand, to satiate curiosity, and to inform.
A compelling aspect of the history of hackers lies in the history of the word itself. To fully understand
how and why these often mutually disparate groups happened to be called the same name, we have
to examine how the computer security definition sprang from its common English definition and how
it evolved to identify these different communities. While it is intractable to provide even a definite
definition of "hacker" due to the constant merging and fracturing of the English language, we will at
the very least, attempt to provide a chronicle of the word's new definitions from their birth to their
entry into standard American English.</b></p>

<p align="justify"><b>In 1971 hackers known as "phreakers" figured out how to gain access to AT&T's long distance system in order to make free long distance calls. 
John Draper earned the title "Cap'n Crunch" due to his realization that a toy whistle given away in a cereal box delivered the perfect tone to hack the phone system. 
During the 1980's people were buying their own personal computers for their homes. 
They connected through the phone network. 
Hackers became more advanced with technology and continued to break into computers and networks.
Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs started selling these refined items called "blue boxes."
 Their function allowed for free calling.
 In 1986 Congress passed the Computer Fraud & Abuse Act.Hackers quickly learned that they could monetize these skills. A black market started to grow.</b></p>
 <h2>Evolutions</h2>
 <p align="justify"><b>
 In 1957, a blind man with perfect pitch, Joe Engressia, found that if he whistled the fourth E above middle C, he could stop a dialed phone recording. A few years later, after meeting Engressia, John Draper realized that a toy whistle distributed in Captain Crunch cereal boxes could make the same pitch and others that gained access to the phone system.
Their findings started a small, underground club called the Phone Phreaks, and soon they needed to find a better tool to make the sounds. This is when Draper invented the blue box, an electronic device that could make a specific set of tones that matched the tones of the phone company used to direct calls.
By using this tool Phone Phreaks could make calls all around the world and access areas of the phone system previously only available to the phone company. Soon, their technology spread around the world and they held conference calls deep inside the phone system where they could talk to others with the same interest
This was like a precursor to chat rooms and forums, such as Reddit and Quora, and even to an extent the dark web.
In 1971, Ron Rosenbaum published an article in Esquire depicting the entire process and names. Once the article was published, many more people around the country tried gaming the system in the same way and caused a backlash to the Phone Phreaks. Soon, possession of a Blue Box could get you two years in jail.
A year later, Captain Crunch was indicted and served four months in jail.</b>

 1988 – Kevin Mitnick
Without his own computer, Mitnik went to Radio Shack and hacked the computers and modems that were located in the store. Just like his idol, John Draper, he used social engineering and with some friends, bluffed their way past a guard into the headquarters of the telephone company and stole technical manuals at the age of 17. He was arrested and served a juvenile sentence.
In 1988, Mitnik hacked into computer giant DEC and copied details of secret software and was soon arrested and served a year in jail.
After his release, he hacked the passwords of investigators following him while he was on parole. This counted as breaking his parole and quickly a judge issued a warrant for his arrest. He spent the next two and a half years on the run and became at one point the FBIs #1 Most Wanted.
When he was finally arrested in 1995, he was held in county jail for four and a half years without a trial. In 1999, he was sentenced to five years in jail, though he had already
 served most of it and was released on supervised release in 2000.</b>

<p align="justify"><b>Modern Days Hacking: By the mid 2000's hacking came from organized criminals, state sponsored hackers, cyber terrorists and hacktivists. 
Examples of political attacks include the interference by the Russians in the 2016 Presidential Election or the Stuxnet virus. 
Hacktivists groups use their passion about certain beliefs to form an attack against a group that they disagree with. 
For example, a hacktivist group known as Anonymous attacked the Church of Scientology by flooding its servers with fake data requests. 
In this case, Anonymous wanted to force the Scientology website to take down a video of Tom Cruise endorsing them from their website. 
Other attackers are in it for the money. They hack into systems and benefit from their successful infiltration by demanding large ransom payments.</b></p>
<p align="justify"><b>Trending Attacks: Attackers are often part of hacking groups and have very detailed plans that take several months or more to carry out.
These attacks penetrate with deep infiltration and have extensive dwell times. You may be familiar with cloud ransom as an attack form. 
MIT suggests that cloud ransom attacks may be on the rise resulting in many large data breaches.</b></p>
 <p align="justify"><b>One of the problems with cloud computing is that there is a shared responsibility for security between the cloud provider and the contracting company. 
 The level of responsibility depends on the service model.
 In addition, cyber-physical attacks such as those targeting electrical grids or transportation systems are a potential target.
 Older planes, trains and ships may be more vulnerable to an attack. Attackers use the attacks or threat of attacks as ransom. 
 MIT also predicts the continued attacks on our voting elections.</b></p>
