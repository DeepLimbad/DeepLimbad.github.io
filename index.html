<h1>What is Ethical Hacking?</h1>
<p align="justify"><b> Ethical hacking and ethical hacker are terms used to describe hacking performed by a company or individual to help identify potential threats on
 a computer or network. An ethical hacker attempts to bypass system security and search for any weak points that could be exploited by malicious hackers. 
 This information is then used by the organization to improve the system security, to minimize or eliminate any potential attacks.<br><br>
 Ethical Hacking sometimes called as Penetration Testing is an act of intruding/penetrating into system or networks to find out threats, vulnerabilities in those systems 
 which a malicious attacker may find and exploit causing loss of data, financial loss or other major damages. The purpose of ethical hacking is to improve the security of 
 the network or systems by fixing the vulnerabilities found during testing. Ethical hackers may use the same methods and tools used by the malicious hackers but with the 
 permission of the authorized person for the purpose of improving the security and defending the systems from attacks by malicious users.
Ethical hackers are expected to report all the vulnerabilities and weakness found during the process to the management.<br><br>
Ethical hacking involves individuals who attempt to find flaws in a company's hardware or software so they can be remedied before a real hacker (a black hat) discovers
 them and uses them for malicious purposes. So, in some ways, you could say that ethical hackers are authorized and even paid to break into their own systems in order to 
 improve and safeguard them.<br><br>
White hat hackers may engage in ethical hacking in a number of ways such as:<br><br>

1.Simulating attacks that could enter the network.<br><br>
2.Using information about the company found online to try to infiltrate the system.<br><br>
3.Testing the security of firewalls, routers and switches.<br><br>
4.Attempting to hack into the company's wireless network.<br><br>
5.Trying to manipulate employees into divulging sensitive information, known by hackers as social engineering.<br><br>
6.Testing the security of physical controls including key cards, doors, alarms or guards.<br><br>
7.Exploiting a company website to uncover security deficiencies.</b></p>
<h1 id="page1">Types of Hackers</h1>
<p align="justify">
<b>1.Black Hat Hackers:<br><br>
The term “black hat” originated from Western movies, where the bad guys wore black hats and the good guys wore white hats.<br><br>
A black-hat hacker is an individual who attempts to gain unauthorized entry into a system or network to exploit them for malicious reasons. 
The black-hat hacker does not have any permission or authority to compromise their targets. They try to inflict damage by compromising security systems, 
altering functions of websites and networks, or shutting down systems. They often do so to steal or gain access to passwords, financial information, and other personal data.<br><br><br>
<b>2.White Hat Hackers:</b><br><br>
White-hat hackers, on the other hand, are deemed to be the good guys, working with organizations to strengthen the security of a system. A white hat has permission to engage 
the targets and to compromise them within the prescribed rules of engagement.
White-hat hackers are often referred to as ethical hackers. This individual specializes in ethical hacking tools, techniques, and methodologies to secure an organization’s 
information systems.<br><br>
Unlike black-hat hackers, ethical hackers exploit security networks and look for backdoors when they are legally permitted to do so. White-hat hackers always disclose every 
vulnerability they find in the company’s security system so that it can be fixed before they are being exploited by malicious actors.<br><br>
Some Fortune 50 companies like Facebook, Microsoft, and Google also use white-hat hackers.<br><br><br>
<b>3.Grey Hat Hackers:</b><br><br>
Grey hats exploit networks and computer systems in the way that black hats do, but do so without any malicious intent, disclosing all loopholes and vulnerabilities to law 
enforcement agencies or intelligence agencies.<br><br>
Usually, grey-hat hackers surf the net and hack into computer systems to notify the administrator or the owner that their system/network contains one or more vulnerabilities 
that must be fixed immediately. Grey hats may also extort the hacked, offering to correct the defect for a nominal fee.</p><br><br>
<h1 id="page2">Difference between Hacking and Ethical Hacking</h1>
<p align="justify">
<b>Hacking is the illegal or legal practice of accessing data stored in any system by experts and hacking professionals.
These experts are termed as Hackers. Hackers have all the knowledge related to programming and its concepts. The mistakes 
that are done by programmers while developing or working on software are picked up by hackers to encroach the security framework of the software. <br><br>
Hacking refers to activities that seek to compromise digital devices, such as computers, smartphones, tablets, and even entire networks. And while hacking might 
not always be for malicious purposes, nowadays most references to hacking, and hackers, characterize it/them as unlawful activity by cybercriminals—motivated by 
financial gain, protest, information gathering (spying), and even just for the “fun” of the challenge.<br><br>
Many think that “hacker” refers to some self-taught whiz kid or rogue programmer skilled at modifying computer hardware or software so it can be used in ways outside
 the original developers' intent. But this is a narrow view that doesn't begin to encompass the wide range of reasons why someone turns to hacking. (For an in-depth 
 look at hackers, read “Under the hoodie: why money, power, and ego drive hackers to cybercrime” by Wendy Zamora.)<br><br>
Hacking is typically technical in nature (like creating malvertising that deposits malware in a drive-by attack requiring no user interaction).
But hackers can also use psychology to trick the user into clicking on a malicious attachment or providing personal data. These tactics are referred to as “social engineering.”<br><br>
<b>Ethical Hacking</b> sometimes called as Penetration Testing is an act of intruding/penetrating into system or networks to find out threats, 
vulnerabilities in those systems which a malicious attacker may find and exploit causing loss of data, financial loss or other major damages.
The purpose of ethical hacking is to improve the security of the network or systems by fixing the vulnerabilities found during testing.

<h1 id="page3">Pre-Requisites</h1>
<p align="justify">
<b>Networking (Intermediate Level):<b>Networking is must if you are thinking of stepping into the world of hacking. You must know everything about how routers work, switches work, 
the layers of networking, Protocols like HTTP, FTP, TCP, UDP and how they work, Topologies and much more. I am not only talking about the theoretical part but the practical one also.<br><br>
<b>Programming Language:<b> Learning programming Language is not must but is a should learn thing. Programming gives you the power to build your own tools or understand 
how tools work and modify them.<br><br>
<b>Connection to Technology:<b> You cannot become hacker if you don't know what are you hacking into. This knowledge comes from the part that how much you are into the tech. 
ou must have the habbit of reading about different things all the time like About Operating systems such as UNIX, Max, Windows how they work what are the faults , 
about mobile phones , processors. I mean anything related to technology. This will help you in a long term. Trust me I did this and now I find my way to easy to understand things.<br><br>
<b>Linux:<b> If you are really serious towards security or breaking security bend towards linux and leave the shelter of GUI and colorful windows. Get comfortable with Linux - It's command line, installation process, update process. You can work on any Linux like Kali,
 Ubuntu, Parrot as a beginner doesn't make difference but get comfortable with it.<br><br>
 Know how to use the internet and search engines effectively to gather information.
Get a Linux-based operating system and the know the basics commands that every Linux user should know.
Practice makes perfect, a good hacker should be hard working and positively contribute to the hacker community. He/she can contribute by developing open source programs,
 answering questions in hacking forums, etc.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
