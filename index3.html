<h1>Certifications (Top 5) </h1>
<h2><b>1.Certified Ethical Hacker</b></h2>
<p align="justify"><b>
The Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) program is the most comprehensive ethical hacking course on the globe to help information security 
professionals grasp the fundamentals of ethical hacking. The hacking course outcome helps you become a professional who systematically
attempts to inspect network infrastructures with the consent of its owner to find security vulnerabilities which a malicious hacker 
could potentially exploit. This hacking course helps you assess the security posture of an organization by identifying vulnerabilities 
in the network and system infrastructure to determine if unauthorized access is possible. The CEH is the first of a series of 3 comprehensive
courses (CEH, ECSA and the APT course) to help a cyber security professional master penetration testing.<br><br>
About the Exam:<br>
 ^ Number of Questions: 125.<br>
 ^ Test Duration: 4 hours.<br>
 ^ Test Format: Multiple choice.<br>

 <p align="justify">
 Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) is an ethical hacking certification offered by Offensive Security that teaches penetration testing methodologies 
 and the use of the tools included with the Kali Linux distribution (successor of BackTrack). The OSCP is a hands-on penetration testing certification, requiring 
 holders to successfully attack and penetrate various live machines in a safe lab environment. It is considered more technical than other ethical hacking 
 certifications, and is one of the few certifications that requires evidence of practical penetration testing skills.<br>
 The course covers common attack vectors used during penetration tests and audit. The course is offered in two formats, either online or live "instructor led" classes.
 The online course is a package consisting of videos, a PDF, lab assignments and lab access. The instructor led course is intensive live training covering the same material,
 also with lab access. The labs are accessible via a high speed internet connection, and contain a variety of operating systems and network devices where the students perform
 their assignments.<b>The OSCP does not require recertification.</b></p>
